# JSX

> >

Let's start by going over one of the things that people like...and dislike about React and that's JSX.

---

# JSX

- JavaScript Syntax Extension
- HTML & JSX
- Templating

> >

JSX is the language that you use to write React, it stands for JavaScript Syntax Extension, but also know and JavaScript XML since it's a combination of JavaScript and something that looks like the old XHTML version of HTML.

Basically it's a way to write HTML inside JavaScript. It has a few strange rules of it's own, but it works real well.

---

# Basic Sample

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Meet the StarGazers</h1>;
}
export default App;
```

> >

Okay, so at first, it looks like regular JavaScript, but you can see that we're using an h1 tag. This is the beauty of JSX, it lets you use both, together in almost perfect harmony.

But, there's a lot of peculiarities to the language, so let's go further.

---

# Single Parent

```jsx
<hgroup>
  <h1>Meet the StarGazers</h1>
  <p>Members of an <b>intergalactic alliance</b>...</p>
</hgroup>
```

> >

You are only allowed to use one parent element in your HTML. So, if I were to remove the hgroup tag here, I would get an error.

Let's take a look at this in CodeSpaces. I'm going to go to the URL for the codespace.

Sometimes, people use a fragment to solve this, so instead of the hgroup tag, you would use an empty element <></>.

---

# Self Closing Tags

```jsx
return (
  <hgroup>
    <img src="images/group.svg" alt="StarGazer Group" />
    <hgroup>
      <h1>Meet the <i>{name}</i></h1>
      <p>Members of an <b>intergalactic alliance</b><br />
        paving the way for peace and benevolence among all species...</p>
    </hgroup>
  </hgroup>
);
```

- `<br />` or `<img />`
- return with `()`

> >

In JSX, all tags have to self-close. So, if I were to remove the slash in the <br /> tag, I would get an error.

The same thing would happen in an image tag.

By the way, when you want to use multi line code in JSX, just like in JavaScript, the return statement can't be on a line by itself. So you have to use parenthesis otherwise your browser's compiler will add a semicolon and break the whole thing.

---

# Reserved Keywords

```
<div className="container">
  <article>
  ...
  </article>
</div>
```

- `className` instead of `class`
- `HTMLFor` instead of `for`

> >

You can't use reserved JavaScript keywords like class or for in jsx.

Instead of class, we use className and similarly with

for, we use HTMLFor. It's something you have to remember and annoy you a bit as you write in JSX.

---

# Expressions

```jsx
const name = 'StarGazers';
...
<h1>Meet the <i>{name}</i></h1>
```

> >

You can use expressions in your code, so if you create a variable for an element, you can use it in the JSX.

The expressions can be a variable name and other valid JavaScript expressions.

```jsx

---

# Inline Styles

<pre><code data-trim data-noescape><script type="text/template">
    <h1>Meet the <i style={{  }}>{name}</i></h1>
</script></code></pre>

> >

You can also use them to pass along values into your tags. This is the way you add inline styles into your code. However instead of writing regular CSS you create an object. If the selector has more than one word, you can also use camelCase.

```jsx

```jsx

---

# camelCase Attributes

```
<button className="outline" onClick={() => alert('Hi There')}>Click me</button>
```

- `onClick`, `onSubmit`, `onChange`

> >

As a matter of fact, all attributes in JSX are camelCased, so for things like an onClick event, you would also use a capital C, but it would be the same for things like onSubmit or onChange.


JSX takes some getting used to, but it's a very powerful language. Once you get comfortable with it, you'll see that it is quite powerful.
